## Introduction

As a DJ you might need to use the same tool for managing your database as you use for your performance as a DJ. You
might see that these use cases are really different and may not be the best setup to have a good performance on
preparing your sessions. Managing a huge library is always a big challenge and so use should use a tools that enables
you to manage your database and prepare sessions in a simple, intuitive way and on any device so you can do it
everywhere you go.

This tool provides you a reliable and easy to use synchronization mechanism between different tools to exacltly fix the
problem described above. The following tools are currently supported:

 * iTunes / AppleMusic to manage your Database everywhere you go
 * Serato DJ Pro to perform as a professional DJ with your hardware

It's planned to also support tools like RecordBox and Virtual DJ if this support is required by some users. So please
let me know if this is what you need.
 
## Use Cases

 * Be independent from Serato / iTunes interface that may not work at a critical time
 * Use the full power of the native Serato DB and Crates, instead of slowing down the perfomance when accessing iTunes from Serato
 * Get rid of synchronisation issues like renamed files that may occur if you use the default Serato / iTunes interface
 * Use the multidevice feature of iTunes / AppleMusic to listen, sort and organize your next Gig / your Crates from everywhere you are
 * Export your Crates (including the Media-Files) to share them between your Colleagues and Friends
 * Export/Import your Database/Crates to/from CSV to do some more analysis and magic operations using some spreadsheet tools (e.g. Excel)
