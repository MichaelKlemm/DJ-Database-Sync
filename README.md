## Introduction

TODO

## Use Cases

 * Be independent from Serato / iTunes interface that may not work at a critical time
 * Use the full power of the native Serato DB and Crates, instead of slowing down the perfomance when accessing iTunes from Serato
 * Get rid of synchronisation issues like renamed files that may occur if you use the default Serato / iTunes interface
 * Use the multidevice feature of iTunes / AppleMusic to listen, sort and organize your next Gig / your Crates from everywhere you are
 * Export your Crates (including the Media-Files) to share them between your Colleagues and Friends
 * Export/Import your Database/Crates to/from CSV to do some more analysis and magic operations using some spreadsheet tools (e.g. Excel)
